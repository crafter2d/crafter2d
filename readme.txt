Crafter 2D, version 0.5.0, Jeroen Broekhuizen
Copyright 2009-2013

Welcome to Crafter 2D! This is the first version of the engine that is being released
as Crafter 2D! It is a huge milestone in history of this engine. In the past year
a lot of time was spend to get the engine to where it is now.

Notice that there currently is no editor to create new worlds. This feature will be
added in the next release. A GUI is currently missing as well and will be implemented
after a basic editor is running.

More information about the engine can be found on the wiki at the SourceForge.net
website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jenginesse/

RUNNING DEMO:
To run the demo application, navigate to the bin directory and execute the game.exe 
file by double clicking on it on windows or by running ./game in the bin directory
on Linux.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If for some reason the application does not start, first check your log file located
in the bin directory. It might contain an error which you can solve, like unsupported
hardware.

In case you find a software bug in the engine, please report them on in the ticket
application. Please fill in as many fields as possible and a clear description of what
is wrong. A reproduction scenario would be appreciated.

For questions or functionality requests you can move to the forums.

KNOWN BUGS:

* Script compiler leaks memory, will be fixed in future patch
* Bugs/compile errors in scripts might crash the engine (not fool proof yet)
