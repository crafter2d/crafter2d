Crafter 2D is an open source game platform for creating 2D games. In the accompanying Crafter Workshop
application you can design your games.

## Credits
Development and fixing by:
 - Jeroen Broekhuizen

## Remarks
This engine still is in an early phase and many developments still take place, so features can be broken,
replaced or removed in later versions. The aim is to keep games created in these early versions running
or able to be upgraded with minimal effort.
